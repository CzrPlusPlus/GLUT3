# GLUT3
Sprite movement with parallax scroll effect

## Note
Project is made using GLUT application in CodeBlocks
*Slight mistake in texture mapping means the images are displayed upright when the source image is upside down.

## Info 
Sprite moves left & right with arrow keys. Left mouse can also be used to make the sprite move left/right.
